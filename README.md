This project is oriented to show how files with the format '.tsv' can be processed, standartized and statistcs calculated based on its features.
As a result, new metrics for standartization can be added as a function, and new codes (like 2) can be added as well.
In order to run this code, you can run .ipynb file or .py file in console, but you nead to import all functions and then run "main" function and add there a name of a file.
